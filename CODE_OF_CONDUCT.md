# Code of Conduct

<p align="center"><a href="https://github.com/MC-Dashify/client/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">English</a> · <a href="https://github.com/MC-Dashify/client/blob/main/.github/documents/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.ko_KR.md">한국어</a></p>

We are a group based on openness and friendly, didactic, discussions.

We aspire to treat everybody equally, and value their contributions.

Decisions are made based on technical merit, efficiency and consensus.

Code is not the only way to help the project. Reviewing pull requests, answering questions to help others on issues, organizing and teaching tutorials, working on the website, improving the documentation, are all priceless contributions.
